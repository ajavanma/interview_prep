# RESIZING
# In the current implementation of HashMap, our hashmap has a lot of collisions. This is because we are using a fixed size for our hashmap.
# To reduce the chances of a collision, we can increase the number of slots (buckets?) in our hashmap. This is called resizing.
# When resizing, we create a new hashmap with a larger number of slots. Then, we re-insert all the key-value pairs from the old hashmap into the new hashmap.

# ASSIGNMENT
# Complete the following methods.

# CURRENT_LOAD()
# This method returns the number of filled buckets in the hashmap as a percentage of the total number of buckets.

# If the length of the underlying list is zero, return 1. Otherwise, divide the number of filled buckets by the length of the underlying list and return it.

# RESIZE()
# If the length of the underlying hashmap is 0, make the length 1 (by just adding a None entry).

# Get the current load. If it's less than 5%, do nothing, we have plenty of space.

# Otherwise, create a new empty hashmap that's 10x the size of the current one, then use the insert method to re-insert all the key-value pairs from the old hashmap into the new one.

# INSERT()
# Call resize() before inserting to make sure there's enough space. Then, insert the key-value pair into the hashmap as normal.
