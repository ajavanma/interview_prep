# A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
# Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.
 
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
# Output: true
# Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = " "
# Output: true
# Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
# Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.


class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Normalize the string: lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters
        filtered = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())

        return filtered == filtered[::-1]
